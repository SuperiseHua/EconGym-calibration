![EconGym Overview](document/img/EconGym%20V2.jpg "EconGym Structure Overview")

**EconGym** is a modular and scalable simulation testbed designed for AI-driven economic analysis, policy optimization, and algorithm benchmarking. Built upon rigorous economic modeling, it supports **25+ benchmark tasks** involving heterogeneous agents—households, firms, banks, and governments—with structured observation, action, and reward interfaces.

Users can simulate multi-agent economic dynamics by flexibly combining economic roles and agent algorithms (e.g., rule-based, reinforcement learning, large language models), enabling reproducible research across disciplines.

## 🚀 How to Run Simulations

You can either use **predefined economic tasks** (fast start), or **customize your own experiments** (advanced use).

### ✅ Option 1: Run Predefined Scenarios (Fast Start)

We provide ready-to-use YAML configurations under `cfg/`:

```bash
python main.py --problem_scene "optimal_monetary"
```

This command loads `cfg/optimal_monetary.yaml`, which specifies the simulation setup. Each `--problem_scene` matches a YAML file in `cfg/`. You can customize these YAMLs or create new ones for your own tasks.

💡 For the full list of predefined tasks and their YAML files, refer to the **User Manual** section above.

**Available options for `--problem_scene` include:**

```text
delayed_retirement
universal_basic_income
wealth_tax
market_type
personal_pension
```

To run multi-government coordination, set `--problem_scene` to one of the supported scenarios, such as:
```bash
python main.py --problem_scene "tre_government"
```
Available options include: "tre_government" and "dbl_government".


------

### 🧪 Option 2: Define Your Own Economic Scenario (Advanced Users)

Advanced users can fully customize the problem setup by modifying parameters in a YAML file. You may also create a new file named `"task_name.yaml"` under the `cfg/` directory and run:

```bash
python main.py --problem_scene "task_name"
```

The most important configurations in the YAML file are the **economic roles** and **agent algorithms**. Other parameters can be tailored to your needs and are explained in more detail in our paper.


#### 1. Configure Economic Roles in YAML

Each role is defined with a `type` field. For example:

```yaml
- entity_name: 'government'
  entity_args:
    params:
      type: "pension"

- entity_name: "households"
  entity_args:
    params:
      type: 'OLG'

- entity_name: 'market'
  entity_args:
    params:
      type: "perfect"

- entity_name: 'bank'
  entity_args:
    params:
      type: 'non_profit'
```

**Supported types:**

| Role       | Type Options                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Household  | `ramsey`, `OLG`                                              |
| Government | `tax`, `pension`, `central_bank`                             |
| Market     | `perfect`, `monopoly`, `oligopoly`, `monopolistic_competition` |
| Bank       | `non_profit`, `commercial`                                   |

#### 2. Select Agent Algorithms

EconGym supports:

- `rule_based` – Hardcoded expert rules (e.g., IMF policy)
- `data_based` – Real policy data (e.g., U.S. retirement age = 67)
- `bc` – Behavior cloning
- `ddpg`, `ppo` – Reinforcement learning
- `llm` – Large language models

Example in YAML:

```yaml
Trainer:
  house_alg: "bc"
  gov_alg: "llm"
  firm_alg: "rule_based"
  bank_alg: "ddpg"
```

You can define your own algorithm in `agents/`.

------



## 📊 Analysis and Visualization

After each simulation, EconGym will store time-series interaction data in `viz/data/`.

### 🔢 Metrics and Evaluation Logic

All evaluation metrics are defined in `runner.py`. In particular:

- `self.init_economic_dict()`: Specifies which economic indicators are initialized and tracked.
- `self._evaluate_agent()`: Uses the `eval_econ` list to determine which variables are saved for visualization and analysis.

Users can freely customize this by modifying `runner.py` to track additional variables.

**Default tracked metrics include:**

```python
eval_econ = ["gov_reward", "house_reward", "social_welfare", "per_gdp", "income_gini",
 "wealth_gini", "years", "GDP", "gov_spending", "house_total_tax",
 "house_income_tax", "house_wealth_tax", "house_wealth", "house_income",
 "house_consumption", "house_pension", "house_work_hours", "total_labor",
 "WageRate", "house_age"]
```

### 📈 Visualization Interface

EconGym includes an interactive dashboard powered by Flask, allowing users to visualize economic metrics over time.

#### 🧭 Step 1: Launch the interface

Run the following command:

```bash
python viz_index.py
```

This will start a local web server.

#### 🌐 Step 2: Open the visualization dashboard

Visit the following address in your browser:

[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

You will see an interface like this:

<img src="document/img/readme/viz.png" style="width:50%;" />

#### 📊 Step 3: Select and generate charts

* Choose the metric you want to visualize.
* Click **"Generate Chart"** to render the chart.

You’ll see dynamic visualizations similar to the examples below:

### 🎥 Dynamic Visualizations

1. **Wealth distribution over time**

3. **Age-specific consumption over time**

4. **Pension flow over time**
   Under the **OLG model**:

   * Positive values indicate receiving pensions
   * Negative values indicate contributing to pension insurance
